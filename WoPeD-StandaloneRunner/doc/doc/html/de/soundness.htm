<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0">Soundness</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0">The most important property of
<a href="workflownet.htm">Workflow Nets</a> is soundness, implying that the 
Petri net model is not only <i>structurally </i>well-formed (as covered by the 
definition of Workflow Nets) but also <i>behaviourally</i> well-formed. This 
means that the only deadlock is caused by the final marking (one token on the 
output place and no token elsewhere) and every complete run (i. e. every 
execution of the net leading from the initial marking with just a token on the 
input place to the final marking with just a token on the output place) 
eventually terminates with no tokens on any other place.</p>
