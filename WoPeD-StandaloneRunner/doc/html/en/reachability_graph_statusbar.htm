<h2>Reachability Graph Statusbar</h2>
<h3>Statusbar States</h3>
The statusbar shows information on the actual reachability graph. In the first image you see the standard statusbar. It contains a legend and a
counter for vertices and edges in the graph. The legend represents the place id's of the petri net in the order as they are in the brackets of
the markings.

<p></p>
If you click on the double-arrow symbol the legend will replace the id's of the places with it's names. Sure, only if the name of a place is set.

Sometimes an orange exclamation mark is additionally shown in the statusbar. That means, that the reachability graph wants your attention. Hover
over the exclamation mark to get a tooltip message with further information.
