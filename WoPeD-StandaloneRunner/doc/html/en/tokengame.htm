<h2>Token Game</h2>

		
		
<p>The token game is the graphical representation of the basic
		<a href="petrinet.htm">Petri net</a> execution rule, describing the following 
		dependency between <a href="transition.htm">transitions</a>, <a href="place.htm">
		places</a> and <a href="token.htm">tokens</a>:</p>

		
<ul>

		  <li>A transition is enabled, if all of its input places have at least one 
		  token</li>

		  <li>An enabled transition can occur - it then removes one token from each 
		  input place and adds one token on each output place</li>

		
</ul>

<p>Note that operator transitions, in particular <a href="xorsplit.htm">XOR-split 
		transitions</a> and <a href="xorjoin.htm">XOR-join transitions</a> used in
		<a href="workflownet.htm">workflow nets</a> have a different behaviour with 
		respect to this occurrence rule.</p>

		
		
<h3>Starting and stopping the Token Game</h3>

		
		
<p>In order to start the token game, press the
		<img src="../images/icons/tokenGame_start.gif" border="0" height="16" width="16">&nbsp; button on the
		<a href="toolbar.htm">toolbar</a>. The <a href="./tokengame_remotecontrol.htm">tokengame remotecontrol</a> is launched for the net in the 
		active <a href="editor.htm">editor</a> window. When clicking play in the <a href="./tokengame_remotecontrol.htm">remotecontrol</a> the net graph becomes read-only (represented 
		by a beige window background) and all transitions which are enabled under the 
		current <a href="marking.htm">marking</a> are highlighted with a small red 
		inscription. To stop the token game, just close the remotecontrol or press the
		<img src="../images/icons/tokenGame_start.gif" border="0" height="16" width="16">&nbsp; button again, the editor 
		window background returns to its normal color and the net becomes editable again.</p>

		
		
<p>If there is initially at least one transition enabled, the user has to choose 
		the next transition to occur by clicking on the associated control element within the net 
		graph. The following two situations can be distinguished:</p>

		
<ul>

		  <li>Choosing a <a href="tokengamenormal.htm">normal or AND transition</a> to 
		  occur</li>

		  <li>Choosing an <a href="tokengamexor.htm">XOR transition</a> to occur</li>

		
</ul>

		
<p>&nbsp;Much more functions for the tokengame are described on the <a href="./tokengame_remotecontrol.htm">tokengame remotecontrol</a> page</p>
