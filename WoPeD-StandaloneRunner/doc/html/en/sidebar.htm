		<h2>Sidebar</h2><br>
		<p>
			The Sidebar is a switchable element on the left side of the editor window. <br>
			It contains two things: the overview and the element-tree.<br><br>		
			The overview is a small overview of the editor and its content. 
			When editing a large net you can use it to navigate within your net.<br><br>
			The element-tree contains all the elements of the current net. 
			You can select an element by clicking on its name in the element-tree.
			In order to select multiple elements hold down your Ctrl key and 
			click on the elements you want to have in your selection.
			<br><br>
			To change the horizontal size of the sidebar you can grab its right border and drag it until
			fits your needs.
