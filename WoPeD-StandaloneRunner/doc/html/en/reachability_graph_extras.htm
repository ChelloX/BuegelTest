<h2>Reachability Graph Extras</h2>
<h3>Coverability</h3>
Computing a reachability graph can be very difficult to handle. Some graph tend to get very big. And some graph are not really solvable
in available time. There is special case of graph that are not ending while computing them. It has to do with unboundedness of a petri
net. A unbounded petri net has places, that can get infinit number of tokens.<br>
To handle this situation and to nevertheless get the graph drawn you can compute a coverability graph. This graph is just like a normal
reachability graph but it can handle unbounded places. It represents unbounded places by a "w" in markings, where a place gets unbound.

<h3>Edge Color Highlighting</h3>
Sometimes - in large reachability graph - it can be difficult to see the incoming and outgoing edges of a marking.
For that reason it is possible to click on a marking to highlight the surrounding edges. See screenshot below at mark 1.<br><br>
Outgoing edges are highlighted in green.<br>
Incoming edges are highlighted in red.

You can also click on a edge so single highlight it. That's useful if you want to see which edge label belongs to which edge.
See screenshot below at mark 2.
