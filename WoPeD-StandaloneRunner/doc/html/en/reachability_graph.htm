<h2>Reachability Graph</h2>
The reachability of a petri net's states can be represented with a <i>reachability graph</i>, a directed graph whose points represent
states (i.e. <i>M</i>) and arcs represent transitions between two such states. The graph is constructed through breadth-first
search as follows: the starting state (<span class="texhtml"><i>M</i><sub>0</sub></span>) is taken, and all
possible transitions are explored from this state, then the transitions from these states, and so on. As the
reachability graph may be infinitely large, breadth-first search is preferred because depth-first search would not
find all possible states even if given infinite time.<br>

<h3>Start Reachability Graph</h3>
Start the reachability graph calculation by clicking the [W] - Button in the toolbar. The Button is only activated if a editor
window is open and focused.
<p></p>
WoPeD will create only one additional window for the reachability graphs. All editors share this single reachability graph window.
In order to that, the reachability graph window will automatically be filled with the reachability graph of the focused editor.
<p></p>
The initial marking of a reachability graph is always in green color (except in gray-scale mode). All other nodes are orange.

<h3>Reachability Graph Window</h3>
<p><img border="0" src="../images/rg_window.png"></p>
<h4>1 Title</h4>
In title is displayed the name of the actual shown editor.
<h4>2 Graph Drawing Place</h4>
The main area of the window consists of graph drawing area. There the graph is displayed. If the resulting graph ist bigger than
the drawing place, it's surrouded by scroll bars. (Behaviour is analog to a normal petri net editor window.)
<h4>3 Toolbar</h4>
<h5>3.1 Refresh - Button</h5>
The refresh button is only active when the underlying petri net has changed. To not accidentally destroy a manual layout the refresh
is always done manually by the user.
<h5>3.2 Layout Chooser</h5>
With layout chooser you can choose a layout.
<h5>3.3 Settings - Button</h5>
By clicking the <a href="reachability_graph_settings.htm">settings</a> button a dialog opens. There you can edit some preferences to the reachability graph.
<h5>3.4 Export as - Button</h5>
By clicking the export button a filechooser dialog opens. There you can export the actual reachability graph
as picture in different file-types.
<h4>4 Statusbar</h4>
The <a href="reachability_graph_statusbar.htm">statusbar</a> shows information that belong to the actual reachability graph.
