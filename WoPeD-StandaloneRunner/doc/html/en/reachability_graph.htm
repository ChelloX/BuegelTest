<h2>Coverability Graph</h2>
The reachability of a petri net's states can be represented with a <i>coverability graph</i>, a directed graph whose points represent
states (i.e. <i>M</i>) and arcs represent transitions between two such states. The graph is constructed through breadth-first
search as follows: the starting state (<span class="texhtml"><i>M</i><sub>0</sub></span>) is taken, and all
possible transitions are explored from this state, then the transitions from these states, and so on. As the
coverability graph may be infinitely large, breadth-first search is preferred because depth-first search would not
find all possible states even if given infinite time.<br>

<h3>Start Coverability Graph</h3>
Start the coverability graph calculation by clicking the <img border="0" src="../images/rg_icon.png" width="16" height="16"> - button in the tool- or menubar. The button is only activated if an editor
window is opened and focused.
<p></p>
WoPeD creates only one additional window for all the coverability graphs. All editors share this single coverability graph window.
In order to do that, the coverability graph window will automatically be filled with the coverability graph of the focused editor window.
<p></p>
The initial marking of a coverability graph is always in a grey-scaled but you can choose a colored mode in the settings.
<p></p>
<h3>Coverability Graph Window</h3>
<p><img border="0" src="../images/rg_window.png"></p>
<h4>1 Title</h4>
The name of the current shown editor is displayed here.
<h4>2 Graph Drawing Place</h4>
The main area of the window consists of a graph drawing area where the graph is displayed. If the resulting graph is bigger than
the drawing area, it is surrouded by scroll bars. (Behaviour is analog to a normal editor window.)
<h4>3 Toolbar</h4>
<h5>3.1 Refresh - Button</h5>
The refresh button can only be activated when the underlying petri net has changed. In order to not to accidentally destroy a manual layout the refresh
has always to be done manually by the user.
<h5>3.2 Unset - Button </h5>
<p>With this button you can unset the state-highlighting. This can also be done by double-click in the background of the coverability graph.</p>
<h5>3.3 Settings - Button</h5>
By clicking the <a href="reachability_graph_settings.htm">settings</a> button a dialog opens. There you can edit some preferences of the coverability graph.
<h5>3.4 Export as - Button</h5>
<p>By clicking the export as button a filechooser dialog opens. There you can export the current coverability graph
  as a picture in different file-formats.</p>
<h5>3.5 Layoutchooser </h5>
With the layout chooser you can select a layout.
<h5>3.6 Zoom </h5>
<p>You can adjust the zoom-level by clicking the buttons to get 10 percent more or less. Some standard zoom-levels can be selected in the box or a value from 20 to 100 can be typed in. </p>
<h4>4 Statusbar</h4>
The <a href="reachability_graph_statusbar.htm">statusbar</a> shows information that belongs to the current coverability graph.
