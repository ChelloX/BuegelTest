		<h2>Wizard</h2>
		<p>
			The Wizard has two tabs and two checkboxes under the tabs. 
			The tabs and the checkboxes are explained in the following description
		</p>
		
		<h3>Assistant</h3>
		<p>
			The Assistant tab is made for beginners. The startpage includes general informations about
			the Petri net, like places and transitions, which can be highlighted. 
			Besides it is possible to navigate from the startpage to the workflow analysis 
			and soundness analysis by clicking the magnifying glass. The magnifying glass just appears, 
			if errors either in the workflow or in the soundness analysis occured.
		</p>
		<p>
			<u>Workflow - Analysis:</u><br />
			The workflow analysis shows errors of basic elements, which are requirements for a 
			valid Petri net. There is a short description beneath each point,
			helping to correct the net.
		</p>
		<p>
			<u>Soundness - Analysis:</u><br />
			The soundness analysis checks the boundedness, liveness, well-structuredness and free choice.
		</p>
		<p>
			By clicking the magnifying glass, you can navigate to a new page, 
			which shows and describes the errors. It's also possible to click 
			on the shown errors to show the incorrect elements in the editor.

		<h3>Expert</h3>
		<p>
			The Expert tab is made for people with advanced Petri net knowledge. You can see a detailed tree
			with informations about the net, soundness and general facts. There are no descriptions or another type of help.

		<p>
			After explaining the two tabs, there are two Checkboxes under the tabs to explain.<br />
			The first Checkbox enables or disables the auto refresh of the sidebar. When it's enabled the sidebar refreshs immediately when the net changes.
			Otherwise the User must refreh the sidebar with the refresh Icon in the upper right corner of the sidebar.<br />
			The second Checkbox is just selectable if the net in the editor is a correct workflow. When selected the t* transition is shown in the net - the net is short circuited.
