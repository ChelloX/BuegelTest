<h2>Reachability Graph Extras</h2>
<h3>Coverability</h3>
Computing a reachability graph can be very difficult to handle. Some graphs tend to get very big or are not really solvable
in available time. There is a special case of reachability graphs that are not ending while computing them. Due to the unboundedness
of a petri net. An unbounded petri net has places, that can get an infinite number of tokens.<br>
To handle this situation and to still get the graph drawn you can compute a coverability graph. This graph is just like a normal
reachability graph but it can handle unbounded places. It represents unbounded places by a "w".

<h3>Edge Color Highlighting</h3>
Sometimes - in large reachability graphs - it can be difficult to see the incoming and outgoing edges of a marking.
For this reason it is possible to click on a marking to highlight the surrounding edges. See screenshot below at mark 1.<br><br>
Outgoing edges are highlighted in green.<br>
Incoming edges are highlighted in red.

You can also click on an edge to highlight it singly. That is useful if you want to see which edge label belongs to which edge.
See screenshot below at mark 2.
