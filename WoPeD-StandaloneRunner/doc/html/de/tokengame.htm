<h2>Token Game</h2>

<p>The token game is the graphical representation of the basic
<a href="petrinet.htm">Petri net</a> execution rule, describing the following 
dependency between <a href="transition.htm">transitions</a>, <a href="place.htm">
places</a> and <a href="token.htm">tokens</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A transition is enabled, if all of its input places have at least one 
  token</li>
  <li>An enabled transition can occur - it then removes one token from each 
  input place and adds one token on each output place</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that operator transitions, in particular <a href="xorsplit.htm">XOR-split 
transitions</a> and <a href="xorjoin.htm">XOR-join transitions</a> used in
<a href="workflownet.htm">workflow nets</a> have a different behaviour with 
respect to this occurrence rule.</p>

<h3>Starting and stopping the Token Game</h3>

<p>In order to start the token game, press the
<img border="0" src="../images/tokenGame_start16.gif" width="16" height="16">&nbsp; button on the
<a href="toolbar.htm">toolbar</a>. The token game is started for the net in the 
active <a href="editor.htm">editor</a> window. The net graph becomes read-only (represented 
by a beige window background) and all transitions which are enabled under the 
current <a href="marking.htm">marking</a> are highlighted with a small red 
inscription. To stop the token game, just press the
<img border="0" src="../images/tokenGame_start16.gif" width="16" height="16">&nbsp; button again, the editor 
window background returns to its normal color and the net becomes editable again.</p>

<p>If there is initially at least one transition enabled, the user has to choose 
the next transition to occur by clicking on the associated control element within the net 
graph. The following two situations can be distinguished:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Choosing a <a href="tokengamenormal.htm">normal or AND transition</a> to 
  occur</li>
  <li>Choosing an <a href="tokengamexor.htm">XOR transition</a> to occur</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
