<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0">Soundness</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0">The most important property of
<a href="workflownet.htm">workflow nets</a> is soundness, implying that the
<a href="petrinet.htm">Petri net</a> model is not only <i>structurally </i>well-formed (as covered by the 
definition of workflow nets itself) but also <i>behaviorally</i> well-formed. This 
means that 
<ul>
<li>the only deadlock is caused by the final marking (one token on the 
output place and no token elsewhere)
<li>every complete run - i. e. every 
execution of the net starting from the initial marking (one token on the 
input place and no tokens elsewhere) eventually leads to the final marking
<li>for every transition there exists at least one execution it occurs in 
</ul>
