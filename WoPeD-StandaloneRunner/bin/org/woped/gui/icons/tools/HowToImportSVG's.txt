1.Step: Run _SVGApplication.java
2.Step: Load the SVG File (your Icon in SVG-Format)
3.Step: The application creates the *SVG_Filename*.java in the same location where the SVG is
4.Step: Put the *SVG_Filename*.java in the package org.woped.gui.icons

Hints: Fonts and writings can cause problems - with the icon tool from acrobat, you can convert letters in "normal lines and circles"
