<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0">Workflow nets</h2>

<div class="plain">
  <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Workflow Nets (WF-Nets) are a 
  notational basis for designing business processes. They are an extension of 
  classical Petri Nets, being established by
  <a href="http://wwwis.win.tue.nl/~wvdaalst">
  <img border="0" src="../images/icons/tango/website.gif" width="16" height="16">Wil van der Aalst</a>. A 
  WF-Net is supposed to have a very regular structure: It must contain exactly 
  one place without input arcs (called <i>input place</i>) and exactly one place 
  without output arcs (called <i>output place</i>). Moreover, the net graph (extended 
  by one &quot;virtual&quot; transition with an arc from the output place and an arc to 
  the input place) must be strongly connected, i. e. from each node there must 
  exist a directed path to every other node. </p>
  <h3>Operator transitions</h3>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0">Four <a href="operatortransition.htm">operator 
  transition</a> types are added to express branching decisions in a more 
  compact way: AND-split, AND-join, XOR-split and XOR-join, each of them being 
  associated with a graphical symbol. Conceptionally, operator transitions 
  are no more than shortcuts (&quot;syntactic sugar&quot;) for an underlying equivalent 
  standard Petri Net construct, such that the formal nature and executability is 
  preserved.</p>
  <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0">Subprocesses</h3>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0">A subprocess concept is added to handle the 
  graphical and logical complexity of large workflow process definitions by 
  modularity. This allows workflow processes contain other WF-Nets as a 
  subprocess. The net notation is simply extended by a <a href="subprocess.htm">
  subprocess transition</a> symbol standing for a particular subprocess. </p>
  <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0">Triggers</h3>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0"><a href="trigger.htm">Triggers</a> are added to 
  the standard Petri net notation in order to represent different kinds of 
  interactive dependency between the process and its operative environment. 
  Three types of trigger are distinguished (plus a fourth, &quot;empty&quot; trigger type). 
  WF-nets allow to assign exactly one trigger type to every transition (including 
  operator transitions). The trigger type is graphically represented by a 
  small, self-explaining icon near the associated transition symbol. </p>
  <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0">Soundness</h3>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0">A very important property of a WF-net is
  <a href="soundness.htm">soundness</a>. 
  <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0">Resources</h3>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0">Several notations are added to map workflow tasks 
  onto <a href="resource.htm">resources</a> by assigning one or more resource classes to all 
  resource-triggered transitions. The classes must be defined and maintained in 
  a separate resource model, consisting of organisational hierarchies, groups 
  and roles.</p>
  <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0">Performance Parameters</h3>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0">The following quantitative performance parameters&nbsp; 
  are assigned to the elements of a Workflow Net: Average number of cases per time 
    unit (arrival rate), average execution duration of a 
    each workflow task, branching probabilities of 
    every arc following an XOR-split transition.</p>
