		<h2>Sidebar</h2><br>
		<p>
			The sidebar is a switchable element on the right side of the editor window. <br>
			It contains two things: the overview and the treeview.<br><br>		
			The overview is a small overview of the editor and its content. 
			When editing a large net you can use it to navigate within your net.<br><br>
			The treeview contains all the elements of the current net. 
			You can select an element by clicking on its name in the treeview.
			In order to select multiple elements hold down your Ctrl key and 
			click on the elements you want to have in your selection.
			The overviewpanel and the treeview panels can be closed by clicking the red close button 
			or by unchecking the corresponding checkbox in the view-ribbon.
			<br><br>
			To change the horizontal size of the sidebar you can grab its right border and drag it until
			fits your needs. You can also change the size of the overview and treeview panels by grabbing 
			the border in the middle.
			<br><br>
