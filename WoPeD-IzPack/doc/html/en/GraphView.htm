<h2>Graph View</h2>

<p>Each resource model has an associated graph model. To change from the resource view to the graph view click on the radio 
button named "Graph View".<br>
The graph view consists of two panels. The left panel contains the role graph and the right panel contains the group graph.
The role panel illustrates the defined roles and compound roles of the resource model.<br>
The group panel illustrates the defined groups and compound groups of the resource model.
Both graphs can be edited. To move a special part of the graph to another place, click on the element you want to move and use drag and
drop to move the element.<br>

By clicking the "Graph View" radio button again, the illustrated graphs will be repainted.

The components of the graphs are coloured in predefined colours.It is possible to change the colours of each element of the panel. To do this select the element you want to alter 
the colour of by clicking on it. Then click the colour editing button <a href="coloringButton.htm">Coloring Button</a>

It is also possible to export the graph models in PNG, GIF and JPG format. To do this click on the <a href="exportButton.htm">Export Button</a>
