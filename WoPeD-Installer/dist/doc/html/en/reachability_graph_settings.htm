<h2>Coverability Graph Settings Dialog</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
The settings dialog allows you to change the setting of the coverability graph. It's divided in 2 sections.

<h4>Graph Visuals</h4>
Here you can edit the width and height of the markings yourself (Mark 1 in image). The more places a petri net has, the more space on the marking is consumed
by text. In this version it's not possible to auto-control the width of the markings. So it is up to one to set the right width.

The arrow titled with number two shows the colour-settings. In this version there are two modes: green/orange coloured or gray-scaled.

Parallel routing means that edges, that go/come from the same two markings are not drawn above each other. If it is enabled (Mark 3 in the image)
the edges are drawn side by side. Parallel routing can be very complex and take a while to compute. In small coverability graphs up
to hundred nodes you won't even notice parallel routing being computed.
<h4>Hierarchic Settings </h4>
Mark 4 points to hierarchic settings. It is a special setting for the hierarchic layout that you can apply to the coverability graph.
It manipulates the horizontal/vertical space between the markings.
