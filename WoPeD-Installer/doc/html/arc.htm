<h2>Arcs</h2>
<p>An arc connects places with transitions of the Petri net or vice versa, i. e. 
it always is referring to element of different types. </p>

<h3>Creating </h3>

<p>In order to draw a new arc between two existing net elements (which must 
always be one <a href="place.htm">Place</a> and one <a href="transition.htm">
Transition</a>) do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Left-click on the center of the element where the arc shall start </li>
  <li>Keep 
  the mouse button pressed down</li>
  <li>Drag the mouse pointer to the center of the element where the arc shall 
  end</li>
  <li>Release the mouse button</li>
  <li>A new arc will be drawn between the two specified elements</li>
</ul>
<p><img border="0" src="images/caution.gif" width="16" height="16"> Note that the center of an element 
is defined as the area where the mouse cursor turns into a pointing finger. At 
all other positions the mouse cursor appears as a normal arrow. Be also aware 
that - due to Petri net syntax - arcs are only allowed to be drawn between 
different element types. </p>

<h3>Removing</h3>

<p>To remove an arc, move the mouse to its location, right-click and choose
<img border="0" src="images/remove16.gif" width="16" height="16"> &quot;Edit -&gt; Remove&quot; from the context 
menu.</p>

<h3>Smart Drawing</h3>

<p>WoPeD supports <i>smart-drawing</i> which can save a lot of time when 
creating large nets. To use this advanced feature, just do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start drawing an arc specifying the starting element as explained above</li>
  <li>Now drag the mouse cursor to an empty editor position </li>
  <li>Release the 
  mouse button </li>
  <li>A new element (place or transition - context-dependent) is automatically created and a new arc will 
  be drawn to it</li>
</ul>
<p>With smart-drawing, Petri nets can be created from scratch just by beginning 
with one place and successively extending the net by adding elements directly in 
the described manner.  </p>

transitions, not for <a href="specialtransition.htm">Special Transitions</a>.</p>
