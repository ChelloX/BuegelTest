<h2>Files Configuration</h2>

<p>In the files group, the following system settings can be defined:</p>

<h3>Default directory</h3>

<p>Select the folder to which all file operations (open, save, save as, export, 
...) automatically shall refer to. If the box &quot;Use default directory&quot; is checked, 
this folder is supposed to be &quot;nets&quot; within the installation path of WoPeD. To 
change this path, just uncheck the box and type in a full path name or use the &quot;Browse&quot; 
button to search for it. </p>

access to this directory!</p>

<h3>Delete recent files</h3>

<p>Press this button to erase the contents of the &quot;Recent&quot; list from the &quot;File&quot; 
menu.</p>

<h3>PNML import/export</h3>

<p>Check these boxes for using the extended <a href="workflownet.htm">Workflow 
Net</a> notation instead of the standard <a href="petrinet.htm">Petri Net</a> 
notation in <a href="pnml.htm">PNML</a> files. Otherwise the extended constructs 
will be ignored. It is usually not recommended to disable these options.</p>

<h3>TPN export</h3>

<p>When using <a href="woflan.htm">Woflan</a> and exporting the current net into 
the associated TPN format, the names of net elements will be included in the 
element descriptions of TPN, making it easier to understand Woflan's diagnostic 
messages. It is recommended to leave this option checked. </p>
