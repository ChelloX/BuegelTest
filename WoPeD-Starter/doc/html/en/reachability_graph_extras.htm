Some graphs    tend to get very big or are not really solvable    in available time. There is a special case of coverability graphs that are    not ending while computing them. Due to the unboundedness    of a petri net. An unbounded petri net has places, that can get an infinite    number of tokens.<br>    To handle this situation and to still get the graph drawn you can compute a    coverability graph. This graph is just like a normal    reachability graph but it can handle unbounded places. It represents    unbounded places by a "&#8734;".    <p></p>    <p><img src="../images/rg_window_coverability.png" border="0"></p>    <p></p>    <h3>Edge Color Highlighting</h3>    Sometimes - in large coverability graphs - it can be difficult to see the    incoming and outgoing edges of a marking.    For this reason it is possible to click on a marking to highlight the    surrounding edges. See screenshot below at mark 1.<br>    <br>    Outgoing edges are highlighted in green.<br>    Incoming edges are highlighted in red.    <p></p>    <p><img src="../images/rg_window_color_transition.png" border="0"></p>    <p></p>    You can also click on an edge to highlight it singly. That is useful if you    want to see which edge label belongs to which edge.    See screenshot below at mark 2. The following state of the your net will be    marked also.    <p></p>    <p><img src="../images/rg_window_color_transition2.png" border="0"></p>    <h3>State-highlighting</h3>    <p>You are also able to highlight the different states of a coverability      graph. It will be colored in blue and also displayed in the editor window.      Removing the state-highlighting will be done by double-click the left      mouse-button in the background of the coverability graph or use the      unsetbutton in the toolbar.</p>    <p>Attention: The editor is blocked while you have highlighted the      coverability graph. You have to unmark the coverability graph if you want      to use the editor again. </p>    <p><img src="../images/editor_rg.gif" border="0"></p>    <p><br>    </p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>  </body></html>
