<h2>Coverability Graph Assistant</h2>

<p>
    This assistant guides the user through the generation of the minimal coverability graph of the underlying Petri net. A <i>minimal</i>
    coverability graph does not contain nodes, that are strictly larger then any other node of the graph. The assistant uses the algorithm
    presented in <i>Minimal Coverability Set for Petri Nets: Karp and Miller Algorithm with Pruning</i>
    <a href="http://pageperso.lif.univ-mrs.fr/~pierre-alain.reynier/publis/PetriNets11.pdf" target="_blank" class="button">(Link)</a>
    written by <i>Pierre-Alain Reynier</i> and <i>Frédéric Servais</i> to calculate the <i>minimal coverability tree</i> which is afterwards
    converted into an graph.
</p>

<h3>User Interface</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="../images/coverability_graph_assistant_window.png" style="width: 80%"></p>
<p>
    The assistant view is divided into two regions. In region one the current graph is shown, while in region two additional information
    about the current process is displayed. </p>

<h3>Procedure</h3>
<p>
    The process is also divided into two parts. In the first step the coverability tree is built by
    analysing node by node. If all nodes have
    been analyzed, the resulting tree is converted into an graph in a second step.
</p>

<h4>Part 1: Building the coverability tree</h4>
<p>
    A unprocessed node (marked with an ?) can be analyzed by clicking at the node or by clicking the button "choose random node" from the
    sidebar. The analysis performs a couple of sequential checks on the contained marking which are listed below. In part 1 the labels of
    the node are extended in some cases with a prefix and a suffix number. The prefix number indicates the step in which the node has been
    analyzed and the suffix number in which step the has been deactivated, e.g the label <img src="../images/cga_inactive.png"
                                                                                              style="vertical-align: middle; height: 1.4em;">
    means that the node with the marking <code>(p4)</code> has been analyzed in step 4 and has been deactivated in step 5.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Check 1:</strong><br>
    The first check ensures that the parent node is still active (has not been disabled).
    If not the node is disabled and no further check is executed.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Check 2:</strong><br>
    The second check validates if the new marking covers an currently active node. If so the token count of the resulting marking is set to
    &omega; for the strictly larger place. A marking is strictly larger than another marking iff the token count of all places is greater or
    equal than the token count of the respective place and at least one place contains more tokens than its counter part in the smaller
    marking.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Check 3:</strong><br>
    The third test checks if an existing active node covers the new marking. If so the node is deactivated and no further checks are
    executed on this node.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Check 4:</strong><br>
    The fourth test checks if the new marking covers the marking of an active node or <b>ANY OF THEIR ANCESTORS</b>. If so, the respective
    active node is deactivated.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Check 5:</strong><br>
    The last test checks if an there are enabled transitions in the new marking.If so, for each of these transitions, a new, unprocessed
    node is added to the graph and linked to the current node.
</p>

<h4>Part 2: Converting the tree into a graph</h4>
<p>
    If the tree does not contain unprocessed nodes anymore, the tree can be converted into a minimal coverability graph with a double click
    on an empty space of the graph or by clicking the respective button in the sidebar. In the conversion all arcs from an active node to an
    inactive node are redirected automatically to the active node, that covers the inactive node. All inactive nodes are removed from the
    graph.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
    Do see all the different checks in an example you can use the net <i>Minimal Coverabiliy Set</i> from the samples and anlayse the nodes
    in the following order: <code>t5 -> t1 -> t3 -> t4 -> t6 -> t4 -> t3 -> t4 -> t3 -> t3</code>
