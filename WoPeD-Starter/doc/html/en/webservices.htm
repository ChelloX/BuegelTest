<h2>Web service</h2>

<p>A Web service is defined by the W3C as "a software system designed to support interoperable Machine to Machine interaction over a network". Web services are frequently just Web APIs that can be accessed over a network, such as the Internet, and executed on a remote system hosting the requested services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The W3C Web service definition encompasses many different systems, but in common usage the term refers to clients and servers that communicate using <a href="xml.htm">XML</a> messages that follow the SOAP standard. Common in both the field and the terminology is the assumption that there is also a machine readable description of the operations supported by the server written in the <a href="wsdl.htm">Web Services Description Language</a> (WSDL). The latter is not a requirement of a SOAP endpoint, but it is a prerequisite for automated client-side code generation in the mainstream Java and .NET SOAP frameworks. Some industry organizations, such as the WS-I, mandate both SOAP and <a href="wsdl.htm">WSDL</a> in their definition of a Web service.</p>
