<h2><span lang=EN-US>Capacity Planning</span></h2>

<p><span lang=EN-US>This is a method of quantitative
analysis used to determine the necessary number of resources in order to run
the business process optimally.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US>In order to use this feature your
process model must be extended by specifying at least the average service time
of each transition, if it is greater than zero, and the split probabilities at
each XOR split transition. Give special attention to the requirement, that the
sum of all probabilities per XOR split is exactly 100%. The probability values
can be changed by opening the properties dialog of the appropriate arc in the
context menu.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US>If you use a resource model, you
should also specify the group and role each transition requires. You can choose
them in the transition properties dialog after selecting the Resource trigger.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US>After opening the Capacity Planning
dialog, you have to give a period of time, the average number of new cases
which arrive at the process within the just specified period and a threshold value.
Please note that internally the program uses a standard time unit which is
displayed just above the first table. You can change the standard time unit by
double-clicking the button [Time model].</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US>When you click on the button [Calculate]
the calculation starts and the results are displayed in both tables below. By
the way, right after opening the dialog the calculation is already done with
the standard time unit.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US>The first table shows the average
service time of each transition, if it is greater than zero, in the second
column as specified in the model. In column three you can see how often each
case is processed by a particular transition on average which is more than one
in the case that this transition is part of a cycle. Column five gives you the
sum of repetitions of all cases as you specified before. In columns four and six
you can see the amount of time needed by a transition to process one or all
cases. The last row of column four shows you the whole time needed (on average)
to operate one case. The same holds for the last line of column six regarding
all cases. The last column of the first table reminds you of the specified
group and role for that transition.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US>There is a number displayed on the
right above the table. This gives the number of decimal places shown in the
table. You can change it by clicking on the left hand or right hand arrow.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US>The second table shows the calculated
minimum number of required resources per resource classes. Column two states
the whole number of time units all resources in this resource class need to process
all the new cases per period. It is just the sum of the demands of all
transitions that require this resource class. Column three gives the results.
Note that these are valid for the given average utilization ratio. The standard
value is 80%. Again you can change it by clicking the arrows.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US>With [Close] you close the dialog.</span></p>
