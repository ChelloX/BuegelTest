<h2><span lang=EN-US>Simulation</span></h2>

<p><span lang=EN-US>Simulation is a method of
quantitative analysis where a business process model is executed and
statistical data gathered.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US>The business process model must give
the average service time of transitions, the split probabilities of XOR splits
and the group / role signature of each transition.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US>When you open the simulation dialog
you will see a lot of information. Just follow it in the normal reading
direction from left to right and from top to bottom. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US>At first you have to give the average
number of new cases per period &#955;, then the period &#960; itself. You
should choose the appropriate time unit for your period. Next you select the
kind of queuing discipline you prefer. After that give the number of simulation
runs. This specifies how often a simulation is repeated. The results shown in the
tables below are the average values of all simulations runs. Next you may
change the termination rule. You can choose between exiting when at least &#955;
cases were finished, when the period has elapsed or both. Selecting both rules
means its logical disjunction. Then the simulation stops when the first of the
two constraints is true.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US>The last two adjustments concern the
probability distribution of the arrival process and the service processes. You
can choose a constant distribution with parameter &#962; where each value in
the interval [(1-&#962;) &#955;, (1+&#962;) &#955;] around mean &#955; or average
service time &#956; respectively has the same probability. &#962; must be an integer
between 0 and 100. Or you choose a Poisson distribution with parameter &#955;&#960;. The third alternative is the normal or Gaussian
distribution with mean &#955; and the standard deviation &#963; which must be given
as parameter.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US>If you prefer another standard time
unit than 1 minute, which is the default, you can change it in the time model
dialog by clicking on [Time model].</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US>After giving all necessary
information you can start the simulation by clicking on [Start]. A wait dialog
appears until all operations are done. Then the tables show the updated results.
In addition three more buttons are activated. In the tables you can see the
statistics of the whole process and each transition, here called servers, and
the utilization ratios of all resource objects.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US>The column titles of the first table
have the following meaning:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1'><span lang=EN-US>L      the
average number of cases in the system</span></p></li>
	<li>
	<p style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1'><span lang=EN-US>Lq</span><span
lang=EN-US>     the average number of cases
waiting</span></p></li>
	<li>
	<p style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1'><span lang=EN-US>Ls     the average number of cases being served</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1'><span lang=EN-US>W     the
average completion time of cases (including service time and wait time)</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1'><span lang=EN-US>Wq</span><span
lang=EN-US>    the average wait time of cases</span></p></li>
</ul>

<p><span lang=EN-US>By clicking on a button in the Details
column another window opens and gives additional information.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US>After the simulation is done you can
examine the protocol by clicking the [Protocol] button, export data into CSV
files by clicking [Export] or have a look at a chart where the operation of
each case by a certain resource at a particular server is shown by clicking on
[Diagram].</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US>With [Close] you can close the
dialog.</span></p>
