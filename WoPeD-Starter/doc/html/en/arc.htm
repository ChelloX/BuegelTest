<h2>Arcs</h2>
<p>An arc connects places with transitions of the Petri net or vice versa, i. e.
    it always is referring to element of different types. </p>

<h3>Creating </h3>

<p>In order to draw a new arc between two existing net elements (which must
    always be one <a href="place.htm">place</a> and one <a href="transition.htm">
        transition</a>) do the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Left-click on the center of the element where the arc shall start</li>
    <li>Keep
        the mouse button pressed down
    </li>
    <li>Drag the mouse pointer to the center of the element where the arc shall
        end
    </li>
    <li>Release the mouse button</li>
    <li>A new arc will be drawn between the two specified elements</li>
</ul>
<p><img border="0" src="../images/icons/check_warning.gif" width="16" height="16">&nbsp; Note that the center of an element
    is defined as the area where the mouse cursor turns into a pointing finger. At
    all other positions the mouse cursor appears as a cross. Be also aware
    that - due to Petri net syntax - arcs are only allowed to be drawn between
    different element types. </p>

<h3>Removing</h3>
<p>To remove an arc, move the mouse to its location, right-click and choose &quot;
    <img border="0" src="../images/remove.gif" width="16" height="16"> Remove&quot; from the context
    menu.</p>

<h3>Smart Drawing</h3>
<p>WoPeD supports <i>smart-drawing</i> which can save a lot of time when
    creating large nets. To use this advanced feature, just do the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Start drawing an arc specifying the starting element as explained above</li>
    <li>Now drag the mouse cursor to an empty editor position</li>
    <li>Release the
        mouse button
    </li>
    <li>A new element (place or transition - context-dependent) is automatically created and a new arc will
        be drawn to it
    </li>
</ul>
<p>With smart-drawing, Petri nets can be created from scratch just by beginning
    with one place and successively extending the net by adding elements directly in
    the described manner. </p>

<p><img border="0" src="../images/icons/check_warning.gif" width="16" height="16">&nbsp; Note that this feature is only defined for normal
    transitions, not for <a href="operatortransition.htm">operator transitions</a>.</p>

<h3>Arc Routing</h3>
<p>To learn how to modify the topology of arcs see <a href="arcrouting.htm">arc
    routing</a>.</p>

<h3>Arc Weight</h3>
<p>
    It is not possible in WoPeD to add multiple arcs between the same elements. Instead you could set the weight of the arc to an arbitrary
    positive number. The weight of an incoming arc of a transition means that the transition will consume the number of tokens
    corresponding to the weight upon firing. Therefore, the source place must contain at least this number of tokens so that the transition
    can be activated. The weight of an outgoing arc of a transition means that the transition will produce the number of tokens upon firing.
    Outgoing weights do not depend in any way on the incoming weights.

<p>
    To set the arc weight the commands <code>increase arc weight</code> and <code>decrease arc weight</code> from the context menu can be
    used. In addition the arc properties dialog provides the possibility to set the weight direct to an specific number. When a arc weight
    that differs from the standard weight of one is set, the weight is displayed in the middle of the arc.

    &nbsp; Note that arcs with a weight that differs from the standard arc weight of one are not allowed in workflow nets. According to this
    restriction some functions can not be used if arc weights are set.
