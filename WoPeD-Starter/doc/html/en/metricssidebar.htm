<h2>Process Metrics Sidebar</h2>
<div style="width: 60%; margin-right: 15px; float: left">
<b>General</b><br />
The sidebar displays the results from the selected <a href="metric.htm">metric</a> groups. These groups can be switched via the drop-down box at the top.
<br /><br />
<b>Groups</b><br />
For each metric in the different groups you will see the name, the calculated value and a traffic light that is set depending on the defined threshold values.
<br /><br />
<b>Metrics</b><br />
By clicking on any of those metric entries in the sidebar, a detailed view will appear that will provide a description for the metric (if one is available) as well as the threshold values based on which the traffic light icon was displayed. Additionally, the related elements for the calculation in the net will be highlighted if rules to do so are stored in the metric configuration. This is the case for all metrics whose name is displayed in <span style="color: #0000ff">blue</span>.
<br /><br />
<b>View/edit/delete metric in builder</b><br />
In the detailed view of each metric, you will also find an option to either display this metric in the <a href="metricsbuilder.htm">Metrics Builder</a> or edit it there as well as an option to delete that metric. Which options (and hence icons) are available depends on the type of metric: If it is an internal one, distributed by the WoPeD team, you can only view it, but not edit or delete it. Custom metrics however, can be manipulated via the builder or deleted via the sidebar.

<br /><br />
<b>Export values</b><br />
In the top right corner of the sidebar, next to the close button, you have the option to export the currently calculated and displayed values from the sidebar to either a *.TXT or a *.CSV file.
<br /><br />
<b>Discard current highlighting</b><br />
In the lower left corner of the sidebar, you will find an icon to collapse all expanded metric detail panels as well as hiding the currently applied highlighting in the net.
<br /><br />
<b>Link to metrics builder</b><br />
In the lower left corner of the sidebar, you will also find an icon to jump into the <a href="metricsbuilder.htm">Metrics Builder</a>.
