<h2>Petri Nets</h2>

<p>Petri Nets are a graphical and mathematical modeling notation going 
back to <span class="link-external">
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Adam_Petri" target="_blank">
<img border="0" src="../images/icons/tango/website.gif" width="16" height="16">Carl Adam Petri</a></span>'s dissertation published in 1962 at the Technical 
University Darmstadt (Germany). A Petri Net consists of <a href="place.htm">
places</a>, <a href="transition.htm">transitions</a>, and connecting <a href="arc.htm">arcs</a>. Places are drawn as circles, transitions as rectangles 
and arcs as arrows. Input arcs connect places with transitions, output arcs 
connect transitions with places. Places are passive components and are modelling 
the system state. They can contain <a href="token.htm">tokens</a>, depicted as black dots. </p>
<p>The current state of the Petri Net (also called the marking) is given by the 
number of tokens on each place. Transitions are active components modelling 
activities which can occur and cause a change of the state by a new assignment 
of tokens to places. Transitions are only allowed to occur if they are enabled, 
which means that there is at least one token on each input place. By occurring, 
the transition removes a token from each input place and adds a token on each 
output place. The repeated occurrence of transitions and the resulting sequence 
of markings is called the <a href="tokengame.htm">token game</a>. </p>

<p>Petri Nets are traditionally used for describing and analyzing systems that 
are oncurrent, asynchronous, distributed, parallel, nondeterministic and/or 
stochastic. Due to their graphical nature, Petri Nets can be used as a 
visualization technique like flow charts or block diagrams but with much more 
scope on concurrency aspects. As a strict mathematical notation, it is possible 
to apply formal concepts like linear algebraic equations or probability theory 
for investigating the behavior of the modelled system. A large number of 
software tools were developed to apply these techniques, a comprehensive 
overview can be found in the <span class="link-external">

<p>In the last decade, Petri Nets have also become a powerful concept in the 
area of business process modelling and workflow management. An important recent approach is the class of
<a href="workflownet.htm">w</a><a target="_top" href="workflownet.htm">orkflow nets</a>, extending the original Petri Net notation by many useful features needed in the 
area of business processes modelling without sacrificing the mathematical nature 
of the underlying Petri Net formalism.</p>
