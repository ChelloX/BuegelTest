		<h2>Semantical Analysis Wizard</h2>
		<p>
			The Semantical Analysis Wizard consists of two tabs and two checkboxes below the tabs. 
			The funcitionality of these tabs and checkboxes will be explained in the following.</p>
		
		<h3>Assistant</h3>
		<p>
			The Assistant tab is made for beginners. The startpage provides general information about
			the Petri net, e.g. concerning places and transitions, which can be highlighted. 
			Besides, it is possible to navigate from the startpage to the workflow analysis 
			and soundness analysis by clicking the magnifying glass. The magnifying glass only appears if there are any errors regarding either the workflow property or soundness of the Petri net.</p>
		<p>
			<u>Workflow - Analysis:</u><br />
			The workflow analysis shows errors of basic elements, which are requirements for a 
			valid Petri net. There is a short description beneath each point,
			helping to correct the net.
		</p>
		<p>
			<u>Soundness - Analysis:</u><br />
			The soundness analysis checks the boundedness, liveness, well-structuredness and free choice.
		</p>
		<p>
			By clicking the magnifying glass, you can navigate to a new page, 
			which shows and describes the errors. It's also possible to click 
			on the shown errors to show the incorrect elements in the editor.

		<h3>Expert</h3>
		<p>
			The Expert tab is made for people with advanced Petri net knowledge. You can see a detailed tree
			with informations about the net, soundness and general facts. There are no descriptions or another type of help.

		<p>
			After explaining the two tabs, there are two Checkboxes under the tabs to explain.<br />
			The first Checkbox enables or disables the auto refresh of the sidebar. When it's enabled the sidebar refreshs immediately when the net changes.
			Otherwise the User must refreh the sidebar with the refresh Icon in the upper right corner of the sidebar.<br />
			The second Checkbox is just selectable if the net in the editor is a correct workflow. When selected the t* transition is shown in the net - the net is short circuited.

		<h3>
		Navigation
		</h3> belonging to the Assistant tab offer a simple and intuitive navigation. 
		For navigating to any of the provided details pages, please use the magnifying glass 
		<img border="0" src="../images/system-search.png" width="16" height="16">.<br><br>
		
		The backward navigation is realized via three toggle buttons which represent the maximum detail level in which an issue can be displayed, 
		i.e. there is a home button for returning to the start page, followed by two buttons with 
		magnifying glasses on them for the two details levels.
		The toggle buttons will only be enabled when you are actually able to use them.
